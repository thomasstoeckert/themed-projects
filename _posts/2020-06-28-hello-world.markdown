Hello!

This is the first post on my jekyll blog, hosted with github pages. I hope I'm doing this correctly, but we'll see as we go on. 

### What's the purpose of this site?

I really like documenting the work I'm doing, so this site will become a kind-of repository of information, stories, or anything else related to my on-going projects. Speaking of projects...

### What kind of projects can be expected to be seen on this site?

My first project, Project 0x54, is going to be an attempt to create an attraction in previs - as far as I can go, with my current skillset - from the ground up. A ride system, ride animation, story, layout, everything. We'll see how that process fares. 

Other than that, random development ideas might pop up from here from time to time, or one-off projects I decide to do for fun. Again, all to be determined.
